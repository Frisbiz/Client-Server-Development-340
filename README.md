#### Creating Maintainable and Adaptable Programs

Writing maintainable programs means making sure they are easy to understand and update. In the CRUD Python module from Project One, I focused on clear names, organized functions, and helpful comments. This made the code straightforward to use and adapt. In Project Two, this module was crucial for linking the dashboard to the database, making data interactions reliable and efficient. This setup means the module can be reused for other projects needing database connections, saving time in the future.

#### Problem Solving as a Computer Scientist

As a computer scientist, tackling problems involves breaking them into smaller tasks. For Grazioso Salvareâ€™s database and dashboard needs, I identified key features and worked methodically to meet their requirements. This approach was different from past assignments, which were more theoretical. For future projects, I'll continue using strategies like iterative testing and feedback to make sure systems meet client needs effectively.

#### The Importance of Computer Scientists

Computer scientists are essential for creating solutions that help companies work better. In projects like the one for Grazioso Salvare, we design systems that make data easy to access and use, improving how decisions are made. By building tools like dashboards, we enable organizations to reach their goals more efficiently, proving the value of computer science in real-world applications.
